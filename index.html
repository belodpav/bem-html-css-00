				Trim Castle was definitely my favorite castle in Ireland. This is for a few different reasons. First off it was the location where they shot a lot of the movie Braveheart. That's pretty cool. My tour guide pointed out various scenes from the movie and where inside, and outside, the castle they were shot. And the office has a photo album with all kinds of pictures that were taken during the shooting of the movie.

				It is quite amazing the stuff they do when it comes to shooting a movie. They turned a historic ruin of a castle into a functioning little world. Well, functioning in terms of how it looks.
			</p>
			<p class="article__paragraph">And, Trim Castle has a keep right in the center of the grounds and this keep is in just about perfect shape. We had a tour throughout the various floors.</p>

			<p class="article__paragraph">Here is a great view of the castle across the river. The river was important to the castle because it was the means for easily shipping supplies across the country and receiving supplies. There is a special port gate that gains entrance to the river from the castle grounds.</p>
